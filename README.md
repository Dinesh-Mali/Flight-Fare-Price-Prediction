# Flight-Fare-Price-Prediction
We are predicting the fare price of flights using AutoML.

# Introduction
Main aim of this project is to predict the correct Flight fare for any journey using ML and AutoML techniques.

# Motivation
we have often heared traveller saying flight tickets are very unpredictable and are very hard to guess. If one might see a price today
and checks the same flight price tomorrow it's whole different story by then.

Here prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June 2019 between various cities are provided.

# Auto SK Learn
It frees a machine learning user from algorithm selection and hyper parameter tuning. It leverages recent advantages in Bayesian Optimization, 
Meta-learning and ensemble construction.

# Project Flow

1) Data Analysis - Finding out Different relations.

2) Feature Engineering - Processing the data before it feeding to the model.

3) Model Building using ML - Using ML/Dl Algorithms.

4) Model Building using Auto ML.
